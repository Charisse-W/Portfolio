        <h2>About Charisse</h2>

        <p>
          After receiving graduating from college I set out to receive my masters in curriculu and teaching. While attending graduate school I found a part-time job working as a web content specialist and quickly rediscovered my passion for technology and the various ways to organize and design websites using a content management system.
        </p>

        <p>In working closely with an application developer on my team I realized that I wanted to begin persuing how to build sites from scratch. So while I enjoy teaching and working with other educators to create curricula, I also found that I enjoy creating websites for others.</p>

        <p>Now, as a student at <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/">Thinkful</a>, I have begun my journey to becoming a software developer and am happy I made the career switch. </p>

        <p>If you are looking to hire new developer or are looking for a partner for hackathons or project challenges please feel free to reach out! </p>
