        <h2>About Charisse</h2>

        <p>
          After graduating from Mount Holyoke College I set out to receive my Masters in curriculum and teaching. While attending graduate school I began working part-time as a Web Content Specialist and quickly rediscovered my passion for technology and the various ways to organize and design websites using a content management system.
        </p>

        <p>In working closely with an application developer on my team, I developed an interest in understanding how sites could be built from scratch. So while I enjoyed teaching and working with other educators to create curricula, I also found that I had a great desire to dive deeper into web development which has lead me to Software Engineering.</p>

        <p>Now, as a student at <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/">Thinkful</a>, I have begun my journey to becoming a software developer and am happy I made the career switch! </p>

        <p>If you are looking to hire a new developer or a partner for project challenges please feel free to reach out! </p>
